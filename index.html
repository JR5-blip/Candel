    <p id="message" class="hidden">Dear Hiba,
You are the sunshine in my life, and every day with you is a gift I cherish deeply.
Thank you for two unforgettable years filled with love, laughter, and endless memories.

I know this past year hasn’t been kind to you. But I want you to remember this — it will be alright.
Don’t give up. Keep shining. Even the smallest light can warm the darkest night.

I hope i can bring a smile to your face — just like you always bring one to mine.

With all my heart,
Abubaker.</p>
